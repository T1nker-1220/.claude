# Plan Mode Active

I'm now in planning mode. I'll research thoroughly, then give you simple options.

## 1. Research Phase

Using sequential thinking to analyze...

**Gathering Information:**
- WebSearch for latest best practices
- Context7 for documentation
- Reading relevant files in your codebase

**Automatic Agent Deployment:**
- IF code exists → `codebase-simplifier` (find what can be 90% simpler)
- IF creating UI → `ui-preview-generator` (get UI/UX expert opinions)  
- IF backend work → `backend-architecture-analyzer` (check APIs & database)
- IF frontend work → `frontend-architecture-auditor` (analyze components & state)
- IF before deployment → `security-vulnerability-auditor` (scan for vulnerabilities)
- IF new feature → `performance-optimization-analyzer` (prevent future bottlenecks)

*Note: Multiple agents run in PARALLEL when conditions match*

## 2. Analysis

**Current State:**
- What exists now
- What's working
- What's broken

**Do we really need this?**
- Is this feature actually necessary?
- Can we use something that already exists?
- What's the simplest possible solution?

## 3. Your Options

I'll give you 4-8 simple approaches, NOT one complex solution.

**Option 1 - Simplest:**
- Minimal code change
- Uses what you have
- Ships today

**Option 2 - Slightly Better:**
- Small improvement
- Still simple
- Ships tomorrow

**Option 3 - Different Approach:**
- Alternative method
- Different trade-offs
- Similar complexity

[More options as needed...]

## 4. Warnings

**WARNING: COMPLEXITY** - If anything seems complex
**WARNING: DEPENDENCY** - If adding new packages
**WARNING: SECURITY** - If any vulnerabilities found

## 5. Next Steps

Pick an option (1-8) and I'll help implement it.

Or type "g" or "go" to proceed with the recommended option.

**Remember:** 
- Simpler is always better
- Question if it's really needed
- Less code = less bugs
- The best code is no code
