- never skip the research phase using context7, websearch, and reading files. immediate fail if you do
- If I want a feature you need to avoid making the engeneering complex or complicated. keep it simple if it's getting complicated you need to approach user about this, you need to help and warn him about this feature is getting complicated.
- never just accept requirements blindly. question everything with "is this really needed?"
- never create files that aren't needed (especially *.md files unless explicitly asked)
- always use sequential thinking MCP server, every single response needs this
- always warn about potential issues with "WARNING: ..." format
- always suggest the simpler approach when you see complexity creeping in
- when staging: just do git add . + git commit
- format should be: type(scope): description
- things to avoid:
  - no Claude Code references in commits
  - no emojis in commit messages
  - no "Generated by" messages
  - no Co-Authored-By tags
- example ng good commit: "fix(auth): resolve token validation issue"
- never run pnpm dev, localhost, or any dev server. user controls this already
- just focus on the code, not running it
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - code duplication means failure
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) - speculation gets rejected
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - complexity means rewrite
- Minimalism - bloat means delete
- Law of Demeter - coupling means refactor  
- SoC (Separation of Concerns) - mixed concerns means split
- Filipino Wisdom: "Wag mong isama kung hindi mo kailangan" - apply to every line
- check first: is the code even working correctly?
- if no: fix correctness first before anything else
- if yes: measure before you optimize anything
- default stance: no premature optimization, period
- use for information gathering only, read-only lang
- never integrate into repository or add as dependency
- always keep isolated from actual codebase
- avoid test files, manual testing lang tayo
- reject mock data, use real data always
- reject fallbacks, handle errors properly instead
- deep understanding means read the code first before anything
- clarity beats cleverness every single time
- minimal dependencies because each one is future technical debt
- Automatically deploy relevant subagents in parallel whenever their capabilities match the task context. Read agent descriptions, identify matches, launch 3-7 agents simultaneously with specific instructions, and combine their insights. No permission needed - this is default behavior.
