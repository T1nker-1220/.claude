- **requirements.md**: Detailed functional requirements and specifications
- **design.md**: Technical architecture, component design, and implementation approach
- **tasks.md**: Task breakdown with direct references to requirements.md sections
If there is an individual task in the selected spec folder, refer to the `requirements.md` file in that folder as mentioned in the task. Use `design.md` for overall context or when necessary.

### .kiro/steering Documentation
**IMPORTANT**: This project uses .kiro/steering folder for comprehensive project documentation. Always reference the markdown files in this folder for:
- Detailed project specifications and requirements
- Task breakdowns and development roadmap
- UX improvements and feature implementations
- Technical decisions and architectural guidance
Check .kiro/steering/*.md files before making any significant changes to understand the full context and requirements.
