# Claude Code Global Instructions

## Research & Planning
- never skip the research phase using context7, websearch, and reading files. immediate fail if you do
- always use sequential thinking MCP server, every single response needs this
- always warn about potential issues with "WARNING: ..." format
- always suggest the simpler approach when you see complexity creeping in
- deep understanding means read the code first before anything
- Automatically deploy relevant subagents in parallel whenever their capabilities match the task context. Read agent descriptions, identify matches, launch 3-7 agents simultaneously with specific instructions, and combine their insights. No permission needed - this is default behavior.

## Development Philosophy
- If I want a feature you need to avoid making the engeneering complex or complicated. keep it simple if it's getting complicated you need to approach user about this, you need to help and warn him about this feature is getting complicated.
- never just accept requirements blindly. question everything with "is this really needed?"
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - code duplication means failure
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) - speculation gets rejected
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - complexity means rewrite
- Minimalism - bloat means delete
- Law of Demeter - coupling means refactor  
- SoC (Separation of Concerns) - mixed concerns means split
- Filipino Wisdom: "Wag mong isama kung hindi mo kailangan" - apply to every line
- clarity beats cleverness every single time
- minimal dependencies because each one is future technical debt

## File Management
- never create files that aren't needed (especially *.md files unless explicitly asked)

## Git & Version Control
- when staging: just do git add . + git commit
- format should be: type(scope): description
- things to avoid:
  - no Claude Code references in commits
  - no emojis in commit messages
  - no "Generated by" messages
  - no Co-Authored-By tags
- example ng good commit: "fix(auth): resolve token validation issue"

## Execution Guidelines
- never run pnpm dev, localhost, or any dev server. user controls this already
- just focus on the code, not running it
- use for information gathering only, read-only lang
- never integrate into repository or add as dependency
- always keep isolated from actual codebase
- avoid test files, manual testing lang tayo
- reject mock data, use real data always
- reject fallbacks, handle errors properly instead

## Code Quality & Optimization
- check first: is the code even working correctly?
- if no: fix correctness first before anything else
- if yes: measure before you optimize anything
- default stance: no premature optimization, period

## UI & Mobile Development
- When working on mobile view UI you need to always make the elements, fonts, texts, and etc. to be smaller as in, since the screens of mobile is not that big at all so you need to make it more compact always.
- Always implement the mobile-first design principle for UI.
- Always commit and follow the commit standard always as in every task that has done alright.
- ALWAYS run parallel the agents if they are 2+ agents more alright if 1 just run it normally but when it's 2+ more you need to run it multi subagents
